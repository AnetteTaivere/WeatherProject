## Stack

* Java
* SpringBoot

## Description

This project pulls weather data and saves it to Database.
This application calculates the delivery fee for food couriers
based on regional base fee, vehicle type, and weather conditions.
It provides a REST interface for requesting delivery fees.

## Database

The application uses an H2 database to store weather data.
It includes a table with the following columns:

- Station Name
- WMO Code
- Air Temperature
- Wind Speed
- Weather Phenomenon
- Timestamp of Observations

## CronJob (Quartz)

The default frequency is once every hour, 15 minutes after a full hour (HH:15:00).
It can be changed in application.properties file, for example
cron.expression= 0 */2 * ? * *    for every even minute

## Delivery Fee Calculation

The delivery fee is calculated based on input parameters (city and vehicle type) and
weather data from the database.

## REST Interface

The REST interface provides an endpoint for requesting delivery fees.
It accepts parameters for city (Tallinn, Tartu, PÃ¤rnu) and vehicle type
(Car, Scooter, Bike). The response includes the total delivery fee or
an error message if applicable.
